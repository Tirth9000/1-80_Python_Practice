# s = "love live and laugh"
# Write a function called multiply_words that takes a string as an argument and
# multiplies the length of each word in the string by the length of other words in the string. 

# For example, the string above should return 240 - love (4) live (4) and (3) laugh (5). 
# However, your function should only multiply words will all lowercase letters. 
# If a word has one upper case letter, it should be ignored. 

# For example, the following string:
# s = "Hate war love Peace" should return 12 â€“ war (3) love (4). 
# Hate and Peace will be ignored because they have at least one uppercase letter.
